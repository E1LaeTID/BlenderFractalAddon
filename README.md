I publish my very first Blender Addon through GitHub.

There are 3 branches to get more infos if you're completely new to blender and you need more detail about the settings.

Step 1 : open the addon ui panel from viewport
Step 2 : get the length value of your like
Step 3 : get the level of detail from 2 to 8 ( or more if your computer can handle it)
Step 4 : click GENERATE
Step 5 : Click CLEAN
Step 6 : rename your object

Since its the version 1.0.0, there are no control bug on the value entries.

I advise the user to get to know more about the fractal before using the plugin to prevent any crash of the application.
